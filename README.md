# 💡 Tips
- 🧩 Practice each pattern on **LeetCode/NeetCode** right after each module.  
- 📓 Maintain notes of patterns — arrays, recursion, tree traversals, etc.  
- ⏰ Use a 45–10 Pomodoro: 45 mins focused + 10 mins break.  
- 🏁 Revise once every weekend to solidify concepts.  
- 🎯 Focus more time on **Dynamic Programming, Graphs, Trees**, and **Backtracking** (they make up ~40% of interview DSA).
